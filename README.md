# Identification-of-a-Second-order-System
I have developed a program that processes a dataset acquired from an oscilloscope, where the input is a sinusoidal signal, and the output is a signal represented as a second-order system.  
In the first part, I performed parametric identification, where each parameter (proportionality factor, damping factor, and natural frequency) was calculated based on indices extracted from the graph.  
The second part of the project involved parametric identification using two specialized functions, ARMAX and IV4.  
Finally, I generated the frequency response diagram, including both the magnitude and phase.
